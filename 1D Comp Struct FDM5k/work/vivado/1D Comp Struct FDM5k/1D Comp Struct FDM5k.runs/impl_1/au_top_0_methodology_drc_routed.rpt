There is a large setup violation of -7.555 ns between game_beta/players/M_p1_col1_q_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_0) and game_beta/players/M_p2_col4_q_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
