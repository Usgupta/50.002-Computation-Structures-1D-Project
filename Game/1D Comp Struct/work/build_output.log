Phase 10 Post Router Timing

Phase 10.1 Update Timing
Phase 10.1 Update Timing | Checksum: 1d3146bfd

Time (s): cpu = 00:00:20 ; elapsed = 00:00:17 . Memory (MB): peak = 1637.684 ; gain = 82.312
INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=1.540  | TNS=0.000  | WHS=-0.477 | THS=-51.878|

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
